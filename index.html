            <p>
                My favorite is vollyball about it: Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.

            <h2>Hebron </h2>
            <p>
                Hebron, also known as Al-Khalil in Arabic, is a historically rich city located in the West Bank of Palestine. It holds immense cultural and religious significance,dating back over 4,000 years. Hebron is renowned for its well-preserved Old City, characterized by narrow, winding streets, ancient architecture, and bustling markets. One of its most iconic sites is the Cave of the Patriarchs, a holy place revered by both Jews and Muslims, as it is said to be the burial site of Abraham and his family. While Hebron's history is marked by complexity and conflict due to its strategic location, it remains a place where history,and contemporary life intersect.
